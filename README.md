# Machine-Learning-
This repository contains my beginner-level Machine Learning practice codes. I am starting with small and simple implementations to understand the fundamental concepts of Machine Learning.
My goal is to gradually build a strong foundation by experimenting with basic algorithms, datasets, and coding techniques. Over time, these small experiments will help me develop larger and more complex Machine Learning projects.

This repository documents my learning journey in Machine Learning step by step.
